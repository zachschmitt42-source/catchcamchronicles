Welcome to Catch Cam Chronicles (“Catch Cam Chronicles,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of our app and related services that help you manage social media accounts and publish videos (collectively, the “Service”). By creating an account, connecting your social media accounts, or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.

If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

1) Who may use the Service

You must be at least 13 years old (or older if your country/platform requires it).

You must have the authority to bind yourself or the company you represent.

You must comply with these Terms and all applicable laws.

2) Your account & security

You are responsible for the activity on your account and for keeping your login credentials safe.

If you suspect unauthorized use, notify us at zach90715@gmail.com.

3) Connecting third-party platforms

The Service may let you connect to third-party platforms (e.g., TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter) to publish or schedule content.

Your authorization. By connecting an account, you authorize us to access that account as your agent solely to perform the actions you request (e.g., upload videos, publish posts, pull analytics).

Third-party terms. Your use of each connected platform remains subject to that platform’s own terms, policies, and community guidelines. If there’s a conflict, the platform’s rules control for that platform.

Revoking access. You can disconnect a platform at any time from your settings or through the platform’s own security settings.

Availability. Integrations and features may change, break, or be discontinued if a platform updates its APIs or policies.

4) Content and licenses

You own your content. You retain all rights to videos, images, captions, and other materials you upload or schedule via the Service (“User Content”).

License to operate the Service. You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, process, format, transcode, and transmit your User Content solely to provide and improve the Service (e.g., queue a post, generate thumbnails, show analytics, troubleshoot issues).

Your responsibilities. You are solely responsible for your User Content and for ensuring you have all necessary rights, permissions, and consents (including music, footage, and likeness rights) to post it.

Prohibited content. Do not upload or post anything illegal; infringing; deceptive; spammy; hateful; harassing; exploitative; or that violates others’ privacy, publicity, or platform rules.

5) Acceptable use

You agree not to:

Use the Service to send spam or to artificially inflate engagement.

Attempt to scrape, reverse-engineer, or interfere with the Service or our systems.

Probe or bypass security; use bots not permitted by platforms; or exceed platform rate limits.

Misrepresent your identity or impersonate others without consent.

Use the Service in any manner that violates laws, regulations, or platform policies.

We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.

6) Scheduled posting, automations, and limits

We try to publish at your scheduled time, but delivery can be affected by platform outages, API limits, file sizes, or network issues.

We may set reasonable usage, size, or rate limits to protect the Service and platform compliance.

7) Privacy & data

What we handle. To operate the Service, we may process account information, connected-platform identifiers, OAuth tokens/permissions, scheduling data, analytics, logs, and your User Content.

How we use it. We use data to operate, secure, and improve the Service; provide support; and comply with law. We do not sell your personal information.

Security. We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to our size and the nature of the Service, but no method is 100% secure.

Data retention. We keep data as needed to provide the Service and for legitimate business or legal purposes. If you disconnect a platform or delete your account, we will remove or de-identify associated tokens and data within a reasonable period, except where we must retain records by law or for legitimate interests (e.g., fraud prevention, accounting).

Your choices. You can request deletion of your account or ask questions by emailing zach90715@gmail.com.

(For more details, see our Privacy Notice if provided separately.)

8) Fees and refunds (if applicable)

Some features may be free; others may require payment or a subscription.

Prices, taxes, billing cycles, and refund rules (if any) will be shown at checkout or in your plan details.

We may change prices or plans with notice for the next billing period.

9) Intellectual property

The Service, including our software, designs, trademarks, logos, and content (excluding your User Content), is owned by Catch Cam Chronicles or its licensors and is protected by law.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the Service unless we give you written permission.

10) Feedback

If you send ideas or suggestions, you grant us a perpetual, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use them without restriction or compensation.

11) Beta and experimental features

We may offer beta features that are provided “as is,” may change at any time, and may be withdrawn without notice.

12) Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE.

13) Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CATCH CAM CHRONICLES AND ITS OWNERS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; LOST PROFITS; LOST REVENUE; LOSS OF DATA; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US FOR THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM OR (B) USD $100.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations; in those cases, the limitations apply to the fullest extent permitted.

14) Indemnification

You will indemnify and hold harmless Catch Cam Chronicles from and against any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your User Content; (b) your use of the Service; (c) your violation of these Terms or any law; or (d) your violation of any third-party or platform rights.

15) Termination

You may stop using the Service at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access immediately if we believe you violated these Terms, posed a security risk, or for other lawful reasons. Upon termination, licenses you granted continue as necessary for us to wind down or comply with law, and sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., ownership, disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnity) will survive.

16) Changes to the Service or these Terms

We may modify the Service or these Terms from time to time. If a change is material, we will provide reasonable notice (e.g., by email or in-app). Changes apply going forward from their effective date. Your continued use after changes take effect means you accept the updated Terms.

17) Governing law; venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, U.S.A., without regard to its conflict-of-laws rules. You and we agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Florida for any dispute not subject to small-claims court or another agreed process.

18) Export and sanctions

You represent that you are not located in, and will not use the Service from, any country or region embargoed by the U.S., and that you are not on any U.S. government restricted-party list.

19) Communications

By using the Service, you agree we may send you service, transactional, and security emails. You can opt out of non-essential marketing emails at any time.

Catch Cam Chronicles — Privacy Policy

Effective date: August 13, 2025
Contact: zach90715@gmail.com

This Privacy Policy describes how Catch Cam Chronicles (“Catch Cam Chronicles,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use our app and related services that help you manage social media accounts and publish videos (the “Service”).

If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not use the Service.

1) Information we collect
a) Information you provide

Account & contact info: name, email address, profile details, and settings.

Content: videos, images, captions, metadata, comments, and scheduling details you upload or create in the Service.

Support messages: questions, bug reports, and feedback you send us.

b) Information from connected platforms (when you link them)

When you connect accounts like TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter, we receive information permitted by the platform and the scopes you approve, such as:

Identifiers & tokens: platform user ID, channel/page ID, OAuth tokens/permissions (not your password).

Publishing & analytics data: video titles, thumbnails, comments/mentions, performance metrics, audience/engagement stats, and posting status.

Content access: media files and drafts needed to upload, schedule, or manage posts.

You can disconnect a platform at any time via our settings or the platform’s own security settings.

c) Automatically collected information

Usage & device data: app interactions, timestamps, IP address, device type, operating system, app version, crash logs, performance metrics.

Cookies & similar tech (on our site): used for sign-in, preferences, and analytics.

We do not intentionally collect sensitive categories of data (e.g., health, precise geolocation) unless you explicitly provide them in your content.

2) How we use information

We use information to:

Provide the Service: authenticate you; connect to third-party platforms; upload, schedule, and manage posts; generate thumbnails; and show analytics.

Maintain & improve: monitor performance, fix bugs, develop new features, and ensure security.

Support & communications: respond to inquiries; send service, transactional, and security notices.

Legal & compliance: prevent abuse, enforce our Terms, and comply with laws and platform policies.

Marketing (optional): send product updates or tips—you can opt out of non-essential marketing at any time.

Legal bases (EEA/UK): contract (to provide the Service), legitimate interests (e.g., security, improvement), consent (when required), and legal obligations.

3) How we share information

We share information only as needed to operate the Service or as required by law:

Service providers (processors): cloud hosting, storage/transcoding, analytics, email delivery, customer support, logging/monitoring. These providers access data only to perform services for us and must protect it.

Connected platforms: when you authorize posting or analytics access, we transmit your content and necessary metadata to those platforms via their APIs.

Business transfers: in a merger, acquisition, financing, or asset sale, data may be transferred subject to this Policy.

Legal and safety: to comply with legal requests, protect rights, prevent fraud or abuse, and ensure safety.

We do not sell your personal information. We also do not share your personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising as defined by California law.

4) Data retention

We keep information only as long as needed to provide the Service and for legitimate business or legal purposes. Typical periods:

Account data: retained while your account is active; deleted or anonymized within a reasonable period after you close your account.

OAuth tokens: revoked or deleted promptly when you disconnect a platform or delete your account (typically within 30 days).

Server logs/diagnostics: typically retained 30–90 days.

Backups: persist for a limited, rolling window (e.g., 30–60 days).

Actual timelines may vary based on legal, security, or operational needs.

5) Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to our size and the nature of the Service (e.g., encryption in transit, restricted token storage, access controls). No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

6) Your choices & rights

Access, update, delete: you can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal information.

Disconnect platforms: remove a platform at any time via settings or the platform’s security page.

Marketing opt-out: unsubscribe from non-essential emails via the link in the message or by contacting us.

Permissions: most mobile platforms allow you to control device-level permissions (e.g., camera, notifications).

EEA/UK users: you may also have rights to object or restrict processing, and to data portability. You can lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.

California residents (CPRA): you have the right to know, correct, and delete personal information; to opt out of “sales” or “sharing” (we do not sell/share); and to limit use of sensitive information (we do not use sensitive information for purposes requiring that right). We do not discriminate for exercising privacy rights.

To exercise any right, email zach90715@gmail.com. We may verify your request and may need information to confirm your identity.

7) Children’s privacy

The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from them. If we learn we have collected such information, we will delete it.

8) International data transfers

If you are outside the United States, your information may be processed in countries with different data protection laws. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) for transfers from the EEA/UK.

9) Third-party services and platforms

Your use of each connected platform remains subject to that platform’s own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party practices. Features and integrations may change if a platform updates its APIs or policies.

10) Do Not Track

Some browsers send “Do Not Track” signals. We currently do not respond to such signals.

11) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. If changes are material, we will provide reasonable notice (e.g., by email or in-app). The “Effective date” above shows when this Policy last changed. Your continued use of the Service after an update means you accept the changes.
